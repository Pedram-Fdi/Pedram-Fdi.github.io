I am currently a PhD candidate at [Concordia University](https://www.concordia.ca/) and a research assistant at [CIRRELT](https://www.cirrelt.ca/default.aspx), supervised by Professors [Hossein Hashemi Doulabi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vOnS59UAAAAJ), [Walter Rei](https://www.concordia.ca/ginacody/info-systems-eng/faculty.html?fpid=walter-rei), and [Michel Gendreau](https://www.cirrelt.ca/michel-gendreau-en). I earned my MSc in Logistics and Supply Chain Management from [Amirkabir University of Technology](https://aut.ac.ir/en) in 2020, under the supervision of Professor [Behrooz Karimi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1hNZYT0AAAAJ), and my BSc from [Isfahan University of Technology](https://english.iut.ac.ir/) in 2017. My CV is available [here](#).

My primary research interests focus on applying stochastic programming and reinforcement learning to supply chain management, logistics and distribution, scheduling, decision-making under uncertainty, and healthcare optimization.
