Currently, I am a Data Scientist at the [DataSphere Lab, McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/bensadoun-school/data-sphere-lab), where I work on exploratory data analysis and demand forecasting using large-scale transactional sales data from INFASCO. My work involves data cleaning, anomaly detection, and outlier handling, as well as developing and deploying machine learning models (XGBoost, LightGBM) to improve sales planning accuracy. I apply advanced feature engineering techniques, optimize models through hyperparameter tuning and rigorous evaluation (RMSE, SMAPE), and design visual analytics to support strategic business decisions.  

I hold a PhD in Operations and Decision Systems from [Concordia University](https://www.concordia.ca/), supervised by Professors [Hossein Hashemi Doulabi](https://www.concordia.ca/faculty/hossein-hashemidoulabi.html), [Walter Rei](https://professeurs.uqam.ca/professeur/rei.walter/), and [Michel Gendreau](https://www.polymtl.ca/expertises/gendreau-michel). I earned my MSc in Logistics and Supply Chain Management from [Amirkabir University of Technology](https://aut.ac.ir/en) in 2020, under the supervision of Professor [Behrooz Karimi](https://aut.ac.ir/cv/2096/BEHROOZ-KARIMI?slc_lang=en&&cv=2096&mod=scv), and my BSc from [Isfahan University of Technology](https://english.iut.ac.ir/) in 2017.  

My primary research interests lie in stochastic programming, reinforcement learning, supply chain management, logistics and distribution, scheduling, decision-making under uncertainty, and healthcare optimization.
