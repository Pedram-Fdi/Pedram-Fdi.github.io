**Data Scientist at [Yeji Data Lab](https://yejidatalab.com/)** specializing in **Operations Research (OR)** and **Machine Learning (ML)**. My work bridges analytical modeling and data-driven intelligence, spanning exploratory data analysis, demand forecasting, and the development of optimization-based machine learning solutions that drive accurate and actionable business insights.  

I focus on building interactive, time-sensitive decision-support tools for high-stakes scenarios, integrating reinforcement learning, prompt engineering, and optimization into production-grade AI systems. With hands-on experience in scenario-based planning, advanced feature engineering, and rigorous model evaluation, I deliver scalable solutions that bridge research and real-world decision-making.  

I hold a PhD in Operations and Decision Systems from [Concordia University](https://www.concordia.ca/), supervised by Professors [Hossein Hashemi Doulabi](https://www.concordia.ca/faculty/hossein-hashemidoulabi.html), [Walter Rei](https://professeurs.uqam.ca/professeur/rei.walter/), and [Michel Gendreau](https://www.polymtl.ca/expertises/gendreau-michel). I earned my MSc in Logistics and Supply Chain Management from [Amirkabir University of Technology](https://aut.ac.ir/en) in 2020, under the supervision of Professor [Behrooz Karimi](https://aut.ac.ir/cv/2096/BEHROOZ-KARIMI?slc_lang=en&&cv=2096&mod=scv), and my BSc from [Isfahan University of Technology](https://english.iut.ac.ir/) in 2017.  

My expertise lies in applying AI and optimization to real-world challenges in **supply chain management, logistics, forecasting, and healthcare systems**, with a focus on turning complex data into practical, high-impact solutions.
