I am currently a PhD candidate at [Concordia University](https://www.concordia.ca/) and a research assistant at [CIRRELT](https://www.cirrelt.ca/default.aspx), supervised by Professors [Hossein Hashemi Doulabi](https://www.concordia.ca/faculty/hossein-hashemidoulabi.html), [Walter Rei](https://professeurs.uqam.ca/professeur/rei.walter/), and [Michel Gendreau](https://www.polymtl.ca/expertises/gendreau-michel). I earned my MSc in Logistics and Supply Chain Management from [Amirkabir University of Technology](https://aut.ac.ir/en) in 2020, under the supervision of Professor [Behrooz Karimi](https://aut.ac.ir/cv/2096/BEHROOZ-KARIMI?slc_lang=en&&cv=2096&mod=scv), and my BSc from [Isfahan University of Technology](https://english.iut.ac.ir/) in 2017.

My primary research interests focus on applying stochastic programming and reinforcement learning to supply chain management, logistics and distribution, scheduling, decision-making under uncertainty, and healthcare optimization.
