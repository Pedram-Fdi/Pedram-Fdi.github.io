**AI-focused Data Scientist at the [DataSphere Lab, McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/bensadoun-school/data-sphere-lab)** with strong expertise in large language models (LLMs), decision intelligence, and operations research. My work spans exploratory data analysis and demand forecasting with large-scale industry datasets, as well as developing machine learning solutions that drive accurate and actionable insights.  

Specialized in building interactive, time-sensitive decision-support tools for high-stakes scenarios, I integrate reinforcement learning, prompt engineering, and optimization into production-grade AI systems. With hands-on experience in scenario-based planning, advanced feature engineering, and rigorous model evaluation, I deliver scalable solutions that bridge research and real-world decision-making.  

I hold a PhD in Operations and Decision Systems from [Concordia University](https://www.concordia.ca/), supervised by Professors [Hossein Hashemi Doulabi](https://www.concordia.ca/faculty/hossein-hashemidoulabi.html), [Walter Rei](https://professeurs.uqam.ca/professeur/rei.walter/), and [Michel Gendreau](https://www.polymtl.ca/expertises/gendreau-michel). I earned my MSc in Logistics and Supply Chain Management from [Amirkabir University of Technology](https://aut.ac.ir/en) in 2020, under the supervision of Professor [Behrooz Karimi](https://aut.ac.ir/cv/2096/BEHROOZ-KARIMI?slc_lang=en&&cv=2096&mod=scv), and my BSc from [Isfahan University of Technology](https://english.iut.ac.ir/) in 2017.  

My expertise lies in applying AI and optimization to real-world challenges in **supply chain management, logistics, forecasting, and healthcare systems**, with a focus on turning complex data into practical, high-impact solutions.
