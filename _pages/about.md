I am currently a PhD candidate at Concordia University and a research assistant at CIRRELT, supervised by Professors Hossein Hashemi Doulabi, Walter Rei, and Michel Gendreau. I earned my MSc in Logistics and Supply Chain Management from Amirkabir University of Technology in 2020, under the supervision of Professor Behrooz Karimi, and my BSc from Isfahan University of Technology in 2017. My CV is available here.

My primary research interests focus on applying stochastic programming and reinforcement learning to supply chain management, logistics and distribution, scheduling, decision-making under uncertainty, and healthcare optimization.
