### Data Science and Operations Research Specialist  
**CIRRELT**, Montreal, QC  
*Jan 2021 – Present*  
- Implemented a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to enhance an AI assistant for disaster planning. The system splits documentation into searchable chunks and retrieves relevant context using keyword-based logic, improving the assistant's ability to answer user queries accurately.
  [▶️ Demo: RAG for ACFs](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BD93wFNPUoqg5aCe8r5Y6V5ys2LtnUjI/view?usp=sharing)
- Developed a Streamlit + LangChain AI assistant to support hospital evacuation planning during disasters. The app interprets free-text queries, extracts structured planning parameters using prompt-based logic and few-shot examples, and invokes a backend optimization engine. Integrated with Azure OpenAI and dynamic user feedback.

- Designed and implemented Reinforcement Learning models (Q-Learning, Deep Q-Learning) integrated with Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) to optimize decision-making processes under uncertainty in complex environments, including disaster management and resource allocation.  
- Developed a Stochastic Dual Dynamic Programming (SDDP) algorithm to solve multi-stage stochastic optimization models, improving resource allocation efficiency in dynamic settings such as disaster response.  
- Applied advanced scenario clustering methods (K-means++, Self-Organizing Maps) combined with stochastic optimization techniques to enhance forecasting, simulation, and decision-making processes in large-scale planning problems.  
- Designed and benchmarked Benders decomposition algorithms to identify optimal locations for temporary hospitals, evaluating their performance against the Progressive Hedging algorithm.
