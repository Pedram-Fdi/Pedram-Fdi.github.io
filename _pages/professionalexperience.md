### Data Scientist  
**Yeji Data Lab**, Montreal, QC  
*Sep 2025 – Present*  
- Focusing on optimization using Operations Research. 

### Data Scientist  
**DataSphere Lab | McGill University**, Montreal, QC  
*Jul 2025 – Sep 2025*  
- Conducted exploratory data analysis on large-scale transactional sales data from [Infasco](https://infasco.com/en/), including cleaning, anomaly detection, and outlier handling.  
- Developed and deployed demand forecasting models using XGBoost and LightGBM, improving prediction accuracy for sales planning.  
- Applied advanced feature engineering (one-hot encoding, temporal feature extraction) to enhance model performance.  
- Optimized models through hyperparameter tuning and rigorous evaluation (RMSE, SMAPE), and visualized results to support business decision-making.  

### Data Science and Operations Research Specialist  
**CIRRELT**, Montreal, QC  
*Jan 2021 – Sep 2025*  
- Built a robust Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using LangChain, Azure OpenAI embeddings, and FAISS to retrieve context from disaster planning docs and answer technical user queries with an LLM, with fallback text search and query classification logic.
  [▶️ Demo: RAG for ACFs](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Cjd3syc1J9SaAxIJAySAnkFLeHKD4u0l/view?usp=sharing)
- Developed a Streamlit + LangChain AI assistant to support hospital evacuation planning during disasters. The app interprets free-text queries, extracts structured planning parameters using prompt-based logic and few-shot examples, and invokes a backend optimization engine. Integrated with Azure OpenAI and dynamic user feedback.  
  [▶️ Demo: LLM for ACFs](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1I1Hlg1Rme-twQYp5AfTtrviWK2hv8EQf/view?usp=sharing)
- Designed and implemented Reinforcement Learning models (Q-Learning, Deep Q-Learning) integrated with Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) to optimize decision-making processes under uncertainty in complex environments, including disaster management and resource allocation.  
- Developed a Stochastic Dual Dynamic Programming (SDDP) algorithm to solve multi-stage stochastic optimization models, improving resource allocation efficiency in dynamic settings such as disaster response.  
- Applied advanced scenario clustering methods (K-means++, Self-Organizing Maps) combined with stochastic optimization techniques to enhance forecasting, simulation, and decision-making processes in large-scale planning problems.  
- Designed and benchmarked Benders decomposition algorithms to identify optimal locations for temporary hospitals, evaluating their performance against the Progressive Hedging algorithm.

### Data Science Intern (Time Series Forecasting)  
**OneGym (formerly Science and Power Fitness Club)**, Isfahan, Iran  
*Jan 2020 – Aug 2020*  
- Conducted comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) on transactional sales data, identifying trends, anomalies, and outliers to inform predictive modeling.  
- Developed and validated demand forecasting models using machine learning techniques (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM) to predict sales quantities, optimizing inventory management.  
- Applied feature engineering, including one-hot encoding and temporal feature extraction, to enhance model accuracy, and utilized hyperparameter tuning and statistical evaluation metrics (RMSE, SMAPE).
