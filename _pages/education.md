### Ph.D. Candidate in Operations Research  
**Concordia University**, Montreal, QC  
*Jan 2021 – Present*  

#### Project 3 – Hospital Evacuation Optimization with Reinforcement Learning
- Developed a combined Reinforcement Learning (Q-Learning, Deep Q-Learning) and Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) algorithm to optimize hospital evacuation strategies in stochastic, post-disaster environments.
- Investigated the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) and prompt engineering to improve the transparency and interpretability of RL-driven operator selection for decision-makers.

#### Project 2 – Resource Allocation Optimization with Dynamic Programming
- Proposed an efficient Stochastic Dual Dynamic Programming (SDDP) algorithm to solve a multi-stage stochastic optimization model for allocating scarce medical resources after disasters.
- Integrated scenario clustering techniques such as K-means++ and Self-Organizing Maps to reduce computational complexity.

#### Project 1 – Temporary Hospital Location Planning with Benders Decomposition
- Developed a Benders decomposition algorithm for locating temporary hospitals in disaster settings.
- Benchmarked its performance against the Progressive Hedging algorithm to evaluate solution quality and efficiency.
