### Ph.D. Candidate in Operations Research  
**Concordia University**, Montreal, QC  
*Jan 2021 – June 2025 (Expected)*  

- Developed a combined Reinforcement Learning approach (Q-Learning, Deep Q-Learning) with an Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) algorithm to optimize hospital evacuation strategies in a stochastic environment.  
- Investigated the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) and prompt engineering to enhance the transparency and interpretability of reinforcement learning-based operator selection within the ALNS algorithm.  
- Proposed an efficient Stochastic Dual Dynamic Programming (SDDP) algorithm to solve a multi-stage stochastic optimization model for allocating scarce resources after disasters, utilizing scenario clustering methods (K-means++, Self-organizing maps).  
- Developed a Benders decomposition algorithm and benchmarked it against the Progressive Hedging algorithm to determine optimal locations for temporary hospitals.
